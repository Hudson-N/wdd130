      <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
      <p>
        I have two cyber security certificates, both worth over $12,000 of training and material. In September of 2023 I completed the GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies (GFACT) certification ($3,000), and in Jun of 2024 I completed the GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC) certification($9,000). Both of which I received full scholarships for achieving a high score in the cyber start program.
I have competed in the AFA’s cyber patriot competition for the past two years and helped lead my team to the state round both years. 
I have done a lot of studying on tryhackme.com and I am currently a level 0x8[Hacker]. (link badge here) I have completed 37 rooms and am in the top 8% of tryhackme users.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        Piano.
        I have been playing the piano for over 12 years starting when I was 6 years old. I love playing and I have played many songs over the years, but some of my favorites are the Maple Leaf Rag by Scott Joplin, Pirates of the Caribbean arranged by Jarod Radnich, into the unknown by the Blasting Company, the Ghost Pepper rag by Pjotr Kolster and Mate Pribelszky, and Piano Fantasy by William Joseph. I trained at the Hoffman academy for a couple of years and that really helped my skills increase from intermediate to early advanced. 
        Chess.
        I have recently got into chess, and I have not competed in any tournaments yet, but I love playing online and I am working on my skills. My online ELO is about 700 for rapid, and I am currently working on getting to 1000. I have only played over 100 games, but it is my newest hobby and a work in progress. My goal is to become an International Master. I know it is a lofty goal, but I like to have a good milestone I can work towards. Besides what’s a goal if it’s not difficult? It is going to take a lot of hard work and practice, but I think I’m up for the challenge.

        Speed cubing.
        Many years ago, I started playing with my brothers Rubik’s cube and was surprised at how hard it was to solve, so I watched an amazing video by JPERM, and was so excited to finally know how to solve it! I worked on getting faster and my time got down to about two minutes, after getting my own cube and practicing a lot and practicing more and upgrading my cube two more times I have eventually arrived at a 13.22 second record average of 5 time and a 10.82 single second record time. It didn’t stop there, since then I have learned to solve over 12 different types of cubes. I have competed in two competitions and in the second one I placed 9th in the 4x4 finals. 
        Cubes: (note these times were achieved in home practice, my WCA results will be linked to this page)
        2x2: single: 0.961, average of 5: 3.989
        3x3: single: 10.823, average of 5: 13.922
        4x4: single: 41.426, average of 5: 53.314
        5x5: single: 1:50.39, average of 5: 2:00.499
        6x6: single: 5:03.02, average of 5: Not set
        7x7: single: 16:39.775, average of 5: Not set

        Flying.
        In January 2024 I started flight training, and I have loved every minute of it. I have flown over 45 hours, and I will be soloing very soon. I love flying cross country flights and showing people the joy of aviation. My current cross-country flights include a flight from Starks Twin Oaks (7S3), to the Dalles OR (KDLS), and a flight from Starks Twin Oaks (7S3) to Corvallis Municipal OR (KCVO)
