            <h1>Flying</h1>
            <a>In January 2024 I started flight training, and I have loved every minute of it. I have flown over 45 hours, and I will be soloing very soon. I love flying cross country flights and showing people the joy of aviation. </a>

            <h1>Cubing</h1>
            <a>I have been cubing for a long time, and I like competing in competitions for it, my cubing journey started when I 
                was messing with my brothers rubiks cube and I didn't like that I couldn't solve it, so I watched a youtube video, and the rest wasn't history,
                because I am still alive.I worked on getting faster and my time got down to about two minutes, after getting my own cube and practicing a lot and practicing more and upgrading my cube two more times I have eventually arrived at a 13.22 second record average of 5 time and a 10.82 single second record time. It didnâ€™t stop there, since than I have learned to solve over 12 different types of cubes. I have competed in two competitions and in the second one I placed 9th in the 4x4 finals.

            <h1>Chess</h1>
            <a>I started playing chess about six months ago, I was at a church camp when a friend challenged me to a chess game, and I said yes. What followed was him 
                kicking my butt, which I didn't like. So when I got home I downloaded the chess.com app and started playing. I'm still not very good but I am improving everyday.
