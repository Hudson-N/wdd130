    <h2>Hudson Nuttall</h2>
    <p>Hey guys! I'm a 17 year old homeschooled kid who loves computers and hacking.(Ethically of course)
        I am planning on becoming a ethical hacker or red teamer, so I'm taking a lot of computer classes from byui to help me get there.
        I currently have 2 cyber security certifications both of which I recieved sholorships for through a hacking competition, 
        and I hope to earn a third one soon.</p>
        
    <p>I love airplanes and I am working on earning my private pilots certificate, I currently have about 36 hours in a Cessna 172 and will be soloing soon.</p>

    <p>I live in Oregon with my parents and three siblings. My brother and I like solving rubiks cubes together and we both have attended competitions,
        one of which I placed 9th over all in 4x4.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my entire life and will be serving a mission next year. One of my favorite scriptures is 2 Timothy 2:3 
        "Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ" I like this scripture because whenever I am having a hard time or I am discouraged
        I remeber that Jesus can help me through hard times.
    </p>
